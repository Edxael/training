# Unit Testing

## Principles

### What is the AAA Pattern in Testing?
### What is TDD? What are the benefits?
### What is the benefit of doing Unit Testing versus the other methods of testing such as UI or API Testing?
### What is code coverage? Why is it important?
### Explain the different parts that make up code coverage. (Statements, Branches, Functions, Lines) 
* What are statements? 
* What kind of code tells you that you are using a statement?
* What are branches? 
* What kind of code tells you that your code has a branch in it? (I.e. list types of branches, think anything type of code that an produce multiple outcomes. One type of branch is an if statement. List other kinds of branches)
* Are try/catches a type of branch? Why is it important to cover erroneous and successful outcomes?
* Why is it important to cover multiple branches of code?
* What are functions in terms of code coverage?
* Why is it important to coverage functions?
* What are lines in terms of code coverage?
* Why is it important to cover lines?
* When an uncovered line is shown as the color yellow in a coverage report, what does that mean?
* When an uncovered line is shown as the color red in a coverage report, what does that mean?

### How does Unit Testing help with refactoring code?
### What is code regression? How does unit testing prevent it?

## Practice

### What is a mock? Why would you use it?
### What is a spy? Why would you use it?
### What is the difference between a mock and a spy? Be specific, why would you use one over the other?
