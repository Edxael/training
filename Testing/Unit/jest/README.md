# Jest Unit Testing

## Getting Started

### How do you install jest into a project?
### How do you run jest as your default `test` script? (e.g. when you run `npm test`, it should run your jest tests)
### What file patterns will jest search for by default when running your tests?
### How do you run jest in `watch mode`? (When there is a change to any file the tests run again.)

## Configuring Jest

### How do you make jest track code coverage? (Hint there are at least two ways.)
### How do you force jest to fail if a certain code coverage percentage is not met? (e.g. 80%)
### How do you configure what files should be included when tracking code coverage? What about what files to exclude?
### What is a test reporter? What are some reporters that you can use with jest?
### How do run setup code before each test is run without using a `beforeEach` or `beforeAll`?
### How do you jest the timeout for a single jest test? How do you change it globally?

## General Testing

### How can you use async/await in your jest tests?
### Why would you use async/await in your jest tests rather than the done callback function?
### What are snapshots? Why would you use them?
### Describe the following global functions and why you would use them: `describe, beforeEach, beforeAll, afterEach, afterAll, it, test`
### Describe what describe.each and it.each are used for.
### Describe what describe.only and it.only are used for.

## Expectations

### How do make assertions in jest? Give examples.
### What are matchers? Be detailed and give examples.
### How do you assert that an error will be thrown when calling a function?
### How do you assert that a promise will be rejected with?
### How do you assert what a promise resolves with?

## Mocking

### What is a mock function? Why would you use one?
### What properties does a mock function contain? Be detailed about its properties, and what those properties might contain?
### Give examples of how to mock the following things: the implementation of a function, resolving a promise, returning a value, throwing an error, rejecting a promise.
### How do you mock a module in jest? (e.g. axios)
### How do you mock a class in jest?
### What is the difference between automatic mocking and manual mocking in jest? Why would you use one over the other?


## Beyond the basics

### How do you create custom matchers?
### What does the `jest-extended` library do? Are other libraries that do similar things?
